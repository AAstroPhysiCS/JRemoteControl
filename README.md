# JRemoteControl

Ow boy... this is by far the most intense project I did.

This program allows you to capture your victim's camera, desktop, microphone and allows you to control his/her PC.
The Audio Capture does sleep the Thread for 10 seconds, since it needs to record 10 seconds of audio.
So beware, the other features might get stuck but after 10 seconds you will hear the voice.
After you've unchecked the Audio Button, you'll get the other features immediately.

Written in Java, used API:

1. JavaFX 
2. OpenCV for Java (Use: Camera Capture and Video Capture)

## How to use?

1. Good question. Well the first thing that you need to do, is to change the Address in "ClientUtil" class.
There, you need to put **your** PC's name in it.
2. You need to be on the same Internet. Whether it's a public Internet or not, does not matter!
3. Have fun :)
