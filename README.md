# JRemoteControl

Ow boy... this is by far the most intense project I did.

This program allows you to capture your victim's camera, desktop, microphone and allows you to control his/her PC.
Written in Java, used API:

1. JavaFX 
2. OpenCV for Java (Use: Camera Capture and Video Capture)

## How to use?

1. Good question. Well the first thing that you need to do, is to change the Address in "ClientUtil" class.
There, you need to put **your** PC's name in it.
2. You need to be on the same Internet. Whether it's a public Internet or not, does not matter!
3. Have fun :)
